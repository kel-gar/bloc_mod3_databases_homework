Operators in SELECT Statements: Checkpoint 5 -  Kelly Garry 07.29.18

1.  Write out a generic SELECT statement.

SELECT title 
FROM books
WHERE title LIKE ‘The Bible’;



2.  Create a fun way to remember the order of operations in a SELECT statement, such as a mnemonic.

So F-ing Wild


     
3.  Given this dogs table, write queries to select the following pieces of data:

Intake teams typically guess the breed of shelter dogs, so the breed column may have multiple words (for example, "Labrador Collie mix").

Display the name, gender, and age of all dogs that are part Labrador.

SELECT name, gender, age
FROM dogs
WHERE breed LIKE ‘%labrador%’;


Display the ids of all dogs that are under 1 year old.

SELECT id
FROM dogs
WHERE age < 1;


Display the name and age of all dogs that are female and over 35lbs.

SELECT name, age
FROM dogs
WHERE gender = ‘F’
AND weight > 35;


Display all of the information about all dogs that are not Shepherd mixes.

SELECT *
FROM dogs
WHERE breed NOT LIKE ‘%shepherd%’;


Display the id, age, weight, and breed of all dogs that are either over 60lbs or Great Danes.

SELECT id, age, weight, breed
FROM dogs
WHERE weight > 60
OR breed = ‘%great dane%’;



4.  Given this cats table, what records are returned from these queries?

SELECT name, adoption_date FROM cats;

name		adoption_date
Mushi		2016-03-22
Azul		2016-04-17
Victoire	2016-09-01


SELECT name, age FROM cats;

name		age
Mushi		1
Seashell	7
Azul		3
Victoire	7
Nala		1


5.  From the cats table, write queries to select the following pieces of data.

Display all the information about all of the available cats.

SELECT *
FROM cats;


Choose one cat of each age to show to potential adopters.

SELECT name 
FROM cats
WHERE gender = ‘M’;


Find all of the names of the cats, so you don’t choose duplicate names for new cats.

SELECT name
FROM cats
WHERE *;



6.  List each comparison operator and explain when you would use it. Include a real world example for each.


< less than, to find dogs less than 25 pounds
SELECT name
FROM dogs
WHERE weight < 25;

> greater than, to find dogs greater than 25 pounds
SELECT name
FROM dogs
WHERE weight > 25;
 
<= less than or equal to, to find dogs less than or equal to 25 pounds.
SELECT name
FROM dogs
WHERE weight <= 25;
 
>= greater than or equal to, to find dogs greater than or equal to 25 pounds.
SELECT name
FROM dogs
WHERE weight >= 25;

!= not equal to, to find dogs not equal to 25 pounds
SELECT name
FROM dogs
WHERE weight != 25;

= equal to, to find dogs that are 25 pounds
SELECT name
FROM dogs
WHERE weight = 25;

<> not equal to, to find dogs not equal to 25 pounds
SELECT name
FROM dogs
WHERE weight <> 25;




7.  From the cats table, what data is returned from these queries?

SELECT name FROM cats WHERE gender = ‘F’;

name
Seashell
Nala


SELECT name FROM cats WHERE age <> 3;

name
Mushi
Seashell
Victoire
Nala


SELECT ID FROM cats WHERE name != ‘Mushi’ AND gender = ‘M’;
(Technically this would not work because `ID` should be `id` in `SELECT ID`)

But if it did work 

id
3
